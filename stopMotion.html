      <p>
         Stop motion is an animated filmmaking technique in which objects are
         physically manipulated in small increments between individually
         photographed frames so that they will appear to exhibit independent
         motion or change when the series of frames is played back. Any kind of
         object can thus be animated, but puppets with movable joints (puppet
         animation) or plasticine figures (clay animation or claymation) are
         most commonly used. Puppets, models or clay figures built around an
         armature are used in model animation. Stop motion with live actors is
         often referred to as pixilation. Stop motion of flat materials such as
         paper, fabrics or photographs is usually called cutout animation.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
         The term "stop motion", relating to the animation technique, is often
         spelled with a hyphen as "stop-motion". Both orthographical variants,
         with and without the hyphen, are correct, but the hyphenated one has a
         second meaning that is unrelated to animation or cinema: "a device for
         automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone
         wrong" (The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition).[2]
