      <p>
         In animation and filmmaking, a key frame (or keyframe) is a drawing or
         shot that defines the starting and ending points of a smooth
         transition. These are called frames because their position in time is
         measured in frames on a strip of film or on a digital video editing
         timeline. A sequence of key frames defines which movement the viewer
         will see, whereas the position of the key frames on the film, video, or
         animation defines the timing of the movement. Because only two or three
         key frames over the span of a second do not create the illusion of
         movement, the remaining frames are filled with "inbetweens".

      <h2>Use of key frames as a means to change parameters</h2>
      <p>
         In software packages that support animation, especially 3D graphics,
         there are many parameters that can be changed for any one object. One
         example of such an object is a light (In 3D graphics, lights function
         similarly to real-world lights. They cause illumination, cast shadows,
         and create specular highlights). Lights have many parameters including
         light intensity, beam size, light color, and the texture cast by the
         light. Supposing that an animator wants the beam size to change
         smoothly from one value to another within a predefined period of time,
         that could be achieved by using key frames. At the start of the
         animation, a beam size value is set. Another value is set for the end
         of the animation. Thus, the software program automatically interpolates
         the two values, creating a smooth transition.
